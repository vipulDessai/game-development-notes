# **Fairlight Audio**

## Tip

- if there is so much of noise, them final result will have low volume, that why add music to fill noise up

## preparations

- right click on the audio clip and [unlink them if possible](./edit.md#link-clips-or-audio-or-unlink-them)
- right click and select "`Normalize audio levels`"
- select target loudness as ITU-R BS 1770-1
- standard for youtube is -14 LKFS

# Order

- select track
- <img src="./images/order.png" />

        - ex. EQ FX DY

# Equilizer

## Noise Reduction

- restoration -> noise reduction

### learn

- use `learn` before using the setting, to capture the noise frequencies
- <img src="./images/effects-noise-reduction-learn.png" />
- move the slider to the point where you want the learning to start
- press learn and play the audio and then stop

## Noise Gate

- <img src="./images/dynamics-noise-gate.png" />
- click on dynamics
- flip to gate
- set the threshold - this cuts any sound that is under this value
